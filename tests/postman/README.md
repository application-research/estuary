# run run_tests.bash

this will 

1. Generate tests and jstests using your new api key and run against localhost unless you change the HOST variable
2. run each of the jstests tests and print out if the test fails and at the end generate summary statistics
3. failing tests can be overridden by creating a file with the name of the test in the jsoverrides folder

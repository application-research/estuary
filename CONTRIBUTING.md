# Contributing to Estuary

This document aims to help you get started with running a local Estuary Service for development.

Estuary welcomes contributions to our [open source projects on Github](https://github.com/application-research).

Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
## Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

Please use [Estuary Support](https://docs.estuary.tech/feedback) to report specific bugs and errors.

## Development

### Initialize & Start Estuary

First, clone Estuary and build it with all the required dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/application-research/estuary.git
cd estuary
make clean all
```

Then run `./estuary setup` to initialize the database as well as the access token. **Make sure to save this token as it'll be used to do almost all API calls**.
```bash
$ ./estuary setup
Auth Token: ESTb43c2f9c-9832-498a-8300-35d9c4b8c16eARY
```

Next, set the `FULLNODE_API_INFO` environment variable to a synced lotus node. This can either be a local Lotus node, or a public endpoint, e.g. `wss://api.chain.love`

```bash
$ export FULLNODE_API_INFO=wss://api.chain.love
```

Start your Estuary Node (Note: if you see error messages like `too many open files`, increase the number of open files allow `ulimit -n 10000`)

```bash
$ ./estuary --logging
```
output

### Initialize & Start a Shuttle

Estuary stores data on IPFS before replicating it to the Filecoin Network. When you store data using Estuary, that data will first go to an `estuary-shuttle` *node* that utilizes IPFS as *hot-storage* before replication to the Filecoin Network begins.

Build the shuttle binary

```bash
$ make estuary-shuttle
```

Then, initialize a shuttle node using the Estuary API endpoint `/admin/shuttle/init` or the admin UI at <host>/admin/shuttle

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ESTb43c2f9c-9832-498a-8300-35d9c4b8c16eARY" -X POST localhost:3004/admin/shuttle/init
{"handle":"SHUTTLE4e8b1770-326c-4c95-9976-7cc1ee12244bHANDLE","token":"SECRET7528ab25-1266-4fa4-86cf-719a43bbcb4fSECRET"}
```

Using the output from the above command, start a shuttle node in development mode

```bash
$ ./estuary-shuttle --dev --estuary-api=localhost:3004 --auth-token=SECRET7528ab25-1266-4fa4-86cf-719a43bbcb4fSECRET --handle=SHUTTLE4e8b1770-326c-4c95-9976-7cc1ee12244bHANDLE --logging --host=localhost:3005
```
output

NB: The above commands can be repeated to create and run more shuttle nodes. 

### API

At this point you may begin adding files to estuary via the API described in the [documentation](https://docs.estuary.tech/api-content-add), or using the golang client [creek](https://github.com/iand/creek).

### API Changes
We use swagger to document all of our endpoints and we require developers to annotate the function that complies with the echo-swagger specification.
